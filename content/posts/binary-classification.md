### Classification

Classification refers to the process of categorizing objects into groups.
Binary classification is a type of classification where objects are categorized into two groups.

The most popular algorithms to perform binary classification are:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors
